<p>Hello and welcome to the Works Of Barry website, which is mainly used as a blog. I am Liam, and WorksOfBarry to me is a safe place to come and post about what I am interested in.</p>

<p>I mainly focus on RPG and ILE languages, although I also develop with Node.js and previously PHP and .NET languages. My favourite topic to talk about is Git, including Git + ILE. Since 2016 I have been a speaker. Mainly in Open-Source, but also some modern RPG/ILE concepts too.</p>
