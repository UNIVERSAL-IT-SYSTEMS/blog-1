<p>So I have migrated my blog to GitHub pages. Tumblr had ruined all my code examples and code examples are the key points to my blog entries.</p>

<p>It seemed like Tumblr did some kind of processing of the custom HTML before it returns it to the client. On Tumblr's edit mode, the code examples looked fine - but when you looked at the blog normally, everything within the pre tag would have no line breaks and all the content would wrap. I spend about two weeks trying to fix it with no luck so I left for GitHub.</p>

<p>Now I get full control over the content and the way it looks, just how I like it! Welcome to the new WorksOfBarry.</p>
