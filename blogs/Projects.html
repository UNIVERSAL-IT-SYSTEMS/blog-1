<p>WorksOfBarry has projects in the works and we're always looking for developers to help contribute!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OSSILE/RelicPackageManager">Relic Package Manager</a> is a package manager for the ILE environment. It's mainly a build tool, but includes the functionality to download a ZIP file from the web and then run the build file. We currently have 25 or so projects, but sadly they're scattered. This project is used within the <a href="https://github.com/OSSILE/OSSILE">OSSILE repository</a>, maintained by IBM.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Club-Seiden/giti">Giti</a> is a Git repository browser for 5250. Currently it allows you to browse repos, view commits (+ revert) and branches (and checkout). More features are coming like creating, viewing and reseting to tags, as well as a git status screen.</li>
  <li>A toy project to help people learn RPG2 - <a href="#" onclick="loadBlog('RPG Toy Language', 'RPG2 Toy Language.html', 19)">read more here</a>.</li>
