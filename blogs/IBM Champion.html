<p>It was announced a few days ago, that I was awarded with IBM Champion 2017. I am very thankful for those that voted for me. I really did not expect it and I will not let you down.</p>

<p>2016 was so far, the best year of my life. New job, lots of travelling and lots of new friends. I am so happy to continue contributing and helping others learn.</p>

<p>2017 is going to be a big year, too. I already have lots of conferences and events booked, as well as lots of open-source stuff to work on.</p>

<p>My things to work on in 2017:
<ul>
  <li>Continue working on my Lua implementation for ILE, including a working DB2 module to have 'CRUD' working against the DB.</li>
  <li>I'd like to add more to my 5250 git client, giti. It's working right now, but I'd like to add a 'current changes' screen where you can view current changes, commit and push.</li>
  <li>I want to work on a basic .NET implementation. Since there is no .NET Core for AIX, I want to created a JIT for .NET programs to be able to run on IBM i. I am yet to work out a plan on my head. <a href="http://www.telerik.com/blogs/understanding-net-just-in-time-compilation">Read more here.</a></li>
  <li>I want to help IBM open-source more of their tools and I am going to push this strongly this year. If they want open-source to be part of IBM i, they must be part of open-source too.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>It's a small list with lots of work. I may not accomplish everything, but I hope to get at least 70% of the list completed by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Thanks again for giving me the chance to be an IBM Champion. Here's to a good year!</p>
