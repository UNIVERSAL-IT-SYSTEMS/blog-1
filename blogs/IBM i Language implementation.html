<p>I think this may be the first time I've hesitated writing a blog post about a project. I'd already made 2(?) videos of the virtual machine and a 20 minute video of the language on top of it - but now a blog post.</p>

<p>For the last 3/4ish weeks I've been writing a virtual machine and a programming language on top of it for IBMi systems. I stopped working on the virtual machine about a week ago and spent my week off work implementing the language on-top of the virtual machine.</p>

<p>It took me 2 days to get the compiler working in a decent state with some fun features. The day that become a working program was my birthday - I spent the rest of the week making fixes and also improving the virtual machine.</p>

<p>
Language features would include
</p><ul><li>Variables + arrays</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Functions + plently of built-in functions</li>
<li>Implicit types</li>
<li>Physical file access</li>
<li>Easy syntax (sadly not the prettiest)</li>
</ul><p>I'm going to talk about the two best features: Functions and Objects.
<br><br>
Functions are great. It's very simple to delcare function parameters and you do not need to specifiy if the function returns a value or not. It's so dynamic, it makes it so the programmer doesn't have to worry very much.
</p><pre>
function displayText
  parameters(textValue)

  printf(textValue)
  
  return textValue
end
</pre>
<br>
Objects are my all time favourite. An object can contain fields, for example, you could have a person object:
<pre>
obj Person
  Name
  Age
end
</pre>
<br>
Then you can write code to create new instances of this person and change it's fields:
<pre>
var PersonObj
PersonObj = new Person
PersonObj-&gt;Name = "Barry"
printf(PersonObj-&gt;Name)
</pre>


<p>It's not far into development really, but it's so dynamic that it doesn't take long to implement new features. One problem I am having is naming the language. The only idea I have in mind is 'Top', because the extention I've been giving the source members is 'TOP' (because it sits on-top of the virtual machine).</p>
