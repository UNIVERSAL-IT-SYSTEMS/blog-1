<p>I haven't blogged in a while. I thought I would tell you what I am up to and what I will be doing in the future.</p>

<h3>What I've done</h3>
<p>I have done a few things in the last month. The first is that I finished the basic CRUD for the LuaILE implementation, which is available (via Relic too!) and working now. <a href="https://github.com/OSSILE/luaILE">You can find out more here</a>.</p>
<p>I've chilled a lot. I felt a bit drained from doing a lot of coding in my spare time. I had spent more time with my girlfriend and friends and now I'm back in the game for what's coming up.</p>

<h3>What's coming</h3>
<p>Conferences, and lots.

<ul>
  <li><b>i-UG in London</b> this March. It's a day conference and I am excited to see what's going on local to me.</li>
  <li><b>RPG & DB2 Summit in Orlando</b>, Florida this March. I'll be showing off the latest stuff in OSSILE, including my Notepad++ stuff and new WIP projects.</li>
  <li><b>PLUS in Dortmund, Germany</b> this March. Going to show off exiting new Node.js tech with Profound Logic. My girlfriend is coming along too!</li>
  <li><b>COMMON US in Orlando</b> this May. Showing my OSSILE stuff again. Vibes are going to be high, open-source roundtable, it's gonna be a damn good time!</li>
  <li><b>LISUG, FASUG and NESTU this May in and around New York & Long Island</b> (I am not very familiar with the area). Talking about Profound Logic tech and maybe some open-source items!</li>
  <li>I am still planning COMMON Europe in Brussles, but should hopefully be going!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>More projects.

<ul>
  <li>JerryScript is something I want to port to ILE. It's an implementation for JavaScript for micro controllers, but there is no reason it can't run in ILE.</li>
  <li>Gravity. A new programming language written in C with a really neat syntax (I'm a big fan) is something I'd love to get going in the ILE environment. I have started this already, but you should <a href="https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity">go check it out</a>.
</ul>
</p>

<p>I have lots to do in so little time. I also have to work on my session matertial for COMMON US as I was asked to do some slides on Node.js and DB2. To be continued!</p>
