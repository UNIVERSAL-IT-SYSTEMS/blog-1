<p>Hey everyone! This is gonna be a pretty long blog post about October and the start of November. I've been writing this blog for just under a month and documents what I've been doing during the busy time of October + start of November.</p>

<h3>RPG & DB2 Summit</h3>
<p>In October I attended the RPG & DB2 Summit and I had the best time ever. I met the System i Developer team, which includes Susan Gantner, Jon Paris and Paul Tuohy - as well as the extra team of Philomena Tuohy, Pat Zollman and Amy & Terry Lantz. They were not joking when they told me it's like a big family. I was very welcomed and even felt like part of a family. Some waiters at restraunts we ate at thought we were all family because of the age differences - I need to grow a beard I think.</p>

<p>The event itself was great. I met lots of nice people and my sessions had great attendance which I am very happy about. The Web Services with Embedded SQL session had 45 and the Open-Source ILE Concepts session has 32, which is great for an 8am start! I will be giving these same sessions at the IBM Techninal University in London and just the Open-Source one at Benelux Power in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>I have to say my favourite part of this event was the socialising. I got to catch up with two of my collueges at Profound and it was fantastic to see them. It's a real shame I don't get to spend time at an office with them. Alan Seiden was also at the event and I feel as if I have a pretty good relationship with Alan - always able to talk technical and personal with him, which is great. He is someone who I can go to if I need any advice on almost anything. I also really appreciate that he came to my web services session. Barbara Morris may be my next favourite person. She is someone I can go to <i>to</i> talk nerdy, which is something I don't do a lot. She is someone I am always very excited to see at conferences. Of course I'd built better friend ship with all the Summit team and funny moments were shared - something I will never forget.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone from the Summit team for making this event one of a kind.</p>

<h3>Benulux Power</h3>
<p>Another great event for me since I get to see those who I am good friends with at IBM: Scott Forstie and Jesse Gorzinski to name two of them. We had a lovely time and lots of memories shared with Ranga too.</p>

<p>Myself, Emily, Jess and Scott were kindly invited to Rudi van Helvoirt's home in which we had dinner with him and his wife. Rudi is part of the CEAC for Europe. It was a lovely bonding session for all and hopefully it will happen again in the future. My open-source ILE session went well. Tough crowd, but those who came up and spoke to me afterwards said it was good and was very new to them - which is really great to hear. It's all about the learning experience.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ranga for inviting me and thanks to all that I had met.</p>

<h3>IBM TechU in London</h3>
<p>I cannot stress how great this event was.
