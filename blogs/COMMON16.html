<p>I am just starting my 4th day at COMMON and I can just say I've had an amazing time - I actually sat it the breakfast breifing as I write this.</p>

<h3>Day 1 - Saturday</h3>
<p>I'd awoke very early this day, it probably didn't help that I was excited. Either way, I was ready to go out by 7, so I left my room and went to the cafe in the hotel and just sat around. The feeling of being in the US was still new to me and it made me very excited.</p>
<p>Shortly after I'd realised where I can collect my COMMON badge, which also includes a free t-shirt and bag. I love the bag, it's my new favourite thing and for some reason I am excited to wear it to work.</p>
<p>Then I started to meet the Club-Seiden bunch. Steph (<a href="https://twitter.com/jordiwes">@jordiwes</a>) actually caught me on an escalator as I was heading back to my room - I procecced to meet her in a few minutes - which led me into meeting Chuk (<a href="https://twitter.com/ChukShirley">@ChukShirley</a>) and Alan (<a href="https://twitter.com/alanseiden">@alanseiden</a>). Alan is a very pieceful guy and I feel as if I put the time in, I could learn a lot from him - not just about development, but about mine and others well-being.</p>
<p>We all left as a group for lunch in NOLA and I had some of the best tasting bread in my life - it was fabulous, one of a kind + the bacon is good too = bacon roll! Then we procecced to a cemetery tour in NOLA. Although it was <b>very</b> hot, I had a great time and learned a lot of history - at the time of writing this I have forgotten all of it.</p>
<p>Then, on the way to the pool I met Trevor (<a href="https://twitter.com/ericjooka">@ericjooka</a>). Trevor is one heck of a guy, very inspiring. A lot of the trip has made me look at how my work life balance is. Currently, my work is on IBM i and my life is 50% on IBM i (the other half is on my girlfriend). He made me think what I actually want from my life and where I want my career to head.</p><p>
</p><p>I started to meet more and more CS members because then I met Dave (<a href="https://twitter.com/php_dave">@PHPDave</a>). He looked and sounded totally different from what I imagined, he's also a great guy. I mainly have to thank him for getting me into Club-Seiden, which leads me into thanking Alan for creating it and then follows on to thanking King Harrion (<a href="https://twitter.com/kingharrison">@kingharrison</a>) for bringing Trevor in because he was the one that got me to COMMON really + a lot more.</p>
<p>Trevor invited me out for dinner that night - and who turns down dinner, not me! I had a lovely time, I met people that are important to him and it was really nice to see.</p>

<h3>Day 2 - Sunday</h3>
<p>This day was the real start to the event. I'd met lots of people and sadly I'd forgotten their names within minutes - but lucky I have their business card so we can keep in touch, which I planned to with anyone who gave me their card. I had to collect my award on stage and at this time I also met Kody (<a href="https://twitter.com/BKodyRobinson">@BKodyRobinson</a>), the Innvovation Award winner.</p>
<p>I had to present this day and the room was fairly packed, it even had some of the CS gang in + Steve Will of IBM (<a href="https://twitter.com/Steve_Will_IBMi">@Steve_Will_IBMi</a>). I got some great feedback from the attendees and they seemed very interested with the the demo of the package manager and the Project Alexis debugger.</p>
<p>Then came the expo/booths; everyone was lovely and I met a lot of IBM people who work on the IBM i OS + the features of it. Infact, I met so many people I couldn't put a number on it; but most importantly I'd like to thank Elizabeth Hudson from IBM marketing (<a href="https://twitter.com/itselizabeth_h">@itselizabeth_h</a>) for keeping me company as I strolling in circles around the booths.</p>

<h3>Key moments</h3>
<p>This section going to cover more key moments, I'm writing this on day 5 so I can only highlight the topics.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough how important the Club-Seiden bunch are to me. All of them are lovely and this trip wouldn't have been as good if I didn't know them. If you're reading this guys, thank you all so much for an amazing time. It's not likely I'm gonna see you again anytime soon, but I hope we cross paths again.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank both Elizabeth and Kody for coming out to dinner with me (or taking me out, whatever you prefer). It was nice to know what your interests are and what you do in your jobs + we even talked about our country's politics.</p>
<p>Trevor Perry is a great man. He's so open and he has really made me look at how I want to live my life. He got me 4 free books (expensive ones..) and he introduced me to some amazing people too, like Steve Will and Jim Buck + more.</p>
<p>The IBM i open-source round table on Tuesday night was very intersting - at the start, the points were mostly focused on open-source on PASE. I brought up the topic of open-source on the ILE and it caused a lot of discussion - and a lot came out of it.</p>

<h3>End</h3>
<p>Like I said, I had an amazing time. I can't stress how grateful I am to Trevor and Club-Seiden. All these people are so smart and I have a lot to learn from them. Thank you COMMON and NOLA for a wonderful time, I will miss it.</p>
