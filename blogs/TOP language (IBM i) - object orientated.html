<p><p>TOP has a new feature which I like to call 'call virtual' - which 'emulate' an object orientated feel in your program - below is the snippet from the documentation. I will be honest, these aren't the best examples - but I couldn't come up with anything better.</p>

<h3>Call virtual</h3>
<p>There is a very useful feature that may allow your program to act more object orientated. You are able to invoke a function through an object, we call this 'Call virtual' function.

</p><pre>
callvirt PersonObj-&gt;setName("Barry")
name = [virt PersonObj-&gt;getName()]
</pre>


<p>
These 'call virtual' features introduce two new keywords, <code>callvirt</code> and <code>virt</code>. <code>callvirt</code> is used as a statement and <code>virt</code> is used as a keyword in an expression. For example, if you had a setter, you'd use the <code>callvirt</code> because no data would come out of it. If you had a getter, you'd use <code>virt</code> within an expression to get the data out - like in the example above.
</p>

<p>
You must declare your 'virtual functions' as regular functions, from there they can be invoked. For example, here's a setter for setName:

</p><pre>
function setName
  parameters(Name)

  this-&gt;Name = Name

  return *WORKING
end
</pre>


<p>
To reference back to the object you're invoking from, you use the <code>this</code> variable which is defined for you when you invoke the function from a 'virtual call'. You're able to access all object's fields using the <code>this</code> variable.</p>

<p>
Here's an example of getName (the getter):

</p><pre>
function getName

  return this-&gt;Name

end
</pre>


<p>
'Call virtual' should be used to contain object specific business logic. For example, if I had an Account object with two fields of Name and Balance I could create have function called addBalance which might look something like this:

</p><pre>
function addMoney
  parameter(Amount)
  
  this-&gt;Balance = [dec this-&gt;Balance + Amount]
end
</pre>


<p>
If I wanted another function to remove an amount, but not let my balance go under 0.00; it may look something like this:

</p><pre>
function removeMoney
  parameter(Amount)
  
  this-&gt;Balance = [dec this-&gt;Balance - Amount]
  
  if(this-&gt;Balance &lt; 0)
    this-&gt;Balance = 0
  end
end
</pre>


<p>
If it was a requirement to get double the amount the Customer object would have, with some kind of validation; it would look like this:

</p><pre>
function getDoubleAmount
  var doubAmount = [this-&gt;Balance * 2]

  ## with a maximum of 1000
  if(doubAmount &gt; 1000)
    doubAmount = 1000
  end

  return doubAmount
end
</pre>


<p>
You could invoke these functions like so:

</p><pre>
callvirt CustObj-&gt;addMoney(100)
printf(CustObj-&gt;Balance)

printf(virt CustObj-&gt;getDoubleAmount())

callvirt CustObj-&gt;removeMoney(110)
printf(CustObj-&gt;Balance)
</pre></p>
