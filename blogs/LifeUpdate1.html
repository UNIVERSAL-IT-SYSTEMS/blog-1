<p>So I work from home now. I haven't written a blog in ages, so this is a bit more about where I'm at and where I'll be going.</p>

<h3>Job</h3>
<p>I work at Profound Logic Software as a Product Developer. They are based in the US and I am based in the UK, so this does mean I work from home. I pay my own taxes now.. it's a lot easier than I had imagined and it does also technically mean I'm a contractor to Profound Logic. I can confirm, I enjoy working from home but do miss spending time at the Profound Logic offices. Working from home means I can eat more, really. That's the only downside so far, is that I am eating more; but I have also started running since I wasn't doing any exercise. Work is going well. Absolutly loving the project I am working on and I feel like I am part of a team.</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>
<p>I have a lot of travelling coming up in October.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://systemideveloper.com/summit/conferences.html">RPG & DB2 Summit</a> in <b>Chicago</b> - I'll be speaking about Embedded SQL (RPG) for web services and Open-Source ILE concepts</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.common.be/Benelux_Power_2016_home_page">COMMON Belgium</a> in <b>Eindhoven, Netherlands</b> - I'll be speaking about Open-Source ILE concepts. My girlfriend will be joining me on this trip too!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www-304.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/zz-en?pageType=page&c=C597991Y36724R73">IBM Power Systems & Storage Technical University</a> in <b>London, United Kingdom</b> - speaking subjects are the same as the RPG & DB2 Summit</li>
  <li><a href="http://info.profoundlogic.com/plus2016">Profound Logic User Seminar</a> in <b>Columbus, Ohio</b> (November) - I'll be with Alex Roytman and we're talking about the new Profound.js project I'm so adamant about.</li>
</ul>
I have a very busy schedule, so hopefully my sleeping pattern holds up.</p>

<h3>End</h3>
<p>Well, that's about it for what's going on in my life right now. I was in IBM Systems Magazine in the SNAPSHOT section, so really big thanks to them for asking. I have an apartment viewing tomorrow with my girlfriend, but it's not too big of a deal.</p>

<p>Hope everyone is well!</p>
